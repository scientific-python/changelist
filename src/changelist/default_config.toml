# ```release-note
# An ideally expressive description of the change that is included as
# a single bullet point. Newlines are removed.

#
# If you modify this regex, make sure to match the content with a capture
# group named "summary". The regex is allowed to match more than once in which

# this regex, `pr_summary_label_regex`, can be used to add independent labels
# to each summary. These labels are sorted with the `label_section_map` the
# same way as regular pull request labels are. E.g. the example below will both
# match and go into separate sections:
#
# ```release-note {label="Bug fix"}
# Make `is_odd()` work for negative numbers.
# ```
#
# ```release-note
# Deprecate `ìs_odd`; use `not (x % 2)` instead! {label="API, Highlight"}
# ```

# If you modify this regex, make sure to match the content with a capture
# group named "label".
